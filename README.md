The collected dataset includes statist of the number of COVID-19 infected people, the condensation of aerosol and gas in the critical season (February 20-March 19) in Tehran and Isfahan. The modified datasets consist of aerosol (PM2.5) condensation in seven days ago to one days before (February 5-March 18) COVID-19 outbreak and daily statistics of the number of CIP in February 20-March 19 in Tehran. Also, we shared our VHDL code, which describes the proposed circuit. 
In the logs of the Noxim simulator, we demonstrated the simulation results' details reported by the deployed SystemC cycle-accurate-based simulator tool (Inspired from the Noxim).  The trace files demonstrate the cycles of all activated components, which are run using GTKwave or Modelsim, or Quartus tool. The text files illustrated the simulation results' details for no prediction, best, standard, and worst assumptions.
